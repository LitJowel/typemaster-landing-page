## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Well, I learned a little trick for the pictures. This propery helps to remove the imaginary margin that is created in the section below the images.

```css
img {
	vertical-align: text-top;
}
```

I had another problem with the media queries, I had use standard breakpoints, but at certain sizes the content didn't look right so I had to set fixed widths and center it horizontally to make it look right until the next breakpoint.
